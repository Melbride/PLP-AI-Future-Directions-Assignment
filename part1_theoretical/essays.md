## Q1: Edge AI vs Cloud-based AI - Latency and Privacy

### How Edge AI Reduces Latency and Enhances Privacy

**Latency Reduction:**
Edge AI processes data locally on devices rather than sending it to remote cloud servers. This eliminates network round-trip time, reducing latency from hundreds of milliseconds to single-digit milliseconds. Critical for real-time applications requiring immediate responses.

**Privacy Enhancement:**
Data remains on the local device, never transmitted to external servers. This provides inherent privacy protection as sensitive information doesn't leave the user's control, reducing exposure to data breaches and unauthorized access.

**Real-world Example: Autonomous Drones**
- **Scenario:** Search and rescue drone navigating through debris
- **Edge AI Implementation:** On-board computer vision processes camera feeds in real-time
- **Benefits:**
  - Sub-10ms object detection for obstacle avoidance
  - No dependency on network connectivity in remote areas
  - Sensitive location data stays on device
  - Immediate decision-making for emergency maneuvers

## Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization

### Comparison in Solving Optimization Problems

**Classical AI Limitations:**
- Exponential time complexity for combinatorial problems
- Limited by classical bit processing (0 or 1)
- Struggles with high-dimensional optimization landscapes

**Quantum AI Advantages:**
- Quantum superposition allows parallel exploration of solution spaces
- Quantum entanglement enables complex correlation modeling
- Potential exponential speedup for specific problem classes
